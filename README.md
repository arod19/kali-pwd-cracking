# kali-pwd-cracking
The idea is to show beginners and people with interest in learning about password cracking how it is done with real tools like John The Ripper and its GUI, Johnny. I will show a demo on how to crack passwords of newly created users with both the command line tool and its GUI. I will also explain more about the password file, what and how data is stored there, and how the toolkit works.

A demonstration of the project can be seen in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivkNpDfZ2P0&t=4s

A complete report of the project can be seen in the attached files of this repository, namely PDF files "part 1" and "part 2".
